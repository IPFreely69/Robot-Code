don't give to Guac just yet because he should struggle with it for a bit,
if he cannot figure it out, give this to him. This will make the robot move.
The cool part of the code is that there is a threshold,
because i was told to do it last year since joysticks are not perfect.
and there is a sort of exponential curve for the joystick
speed control to give more accuracy for lower speeds.
This compiled without problems and since it has  " waitForStart();
" among other things, it is FTC competition ready.
This code is essentially a template for later code and has much room for expansion.
